# Robust Adaptation of Pre-trained Models to Inaccurate Biological Labels via Weak Supervision

## 🚀 Introduction (VenusWSL)
We present VenusWSL, a weakly supervised learning framework that addresses label noise in protein property prediction by leveraging a Gaussian Mixture Model to separate clean and noisy labels, enabling more robust training through a teacher-student approach.
